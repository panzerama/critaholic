# Critaholic
## A web app providing a suite of tools for dungeonmasters

Developed in part using [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051091.do), which 
uses Django and a simple app to demonstrate test driven development, automated deployment, and web development. 

### Why TDD?

From the book: 

"Ultimately, programming is hard. Often, we are smart, so we succeed. TDD is there to
help us out when we’re not so smart. Kent Beck (who basically invented TDD) uses the
metaphor of lifting a bucket of water out of a well with a rope: when the well isn’t too
deep, and the bucket isn’t very full, it’s easy. And even lifting a full bucket is pretty easy
at first. But after a while, you’re going to get tired. TDD is like having a ratchet that lets
you save your progress, take a break, and make sure you never slip backwards. That way
you don’t have to be smart all the time."

### Why Django?

* Django has a large, supportive community
* Django is broadly used
* Python is a versatile language with which I have some experience

### What is what?

Critaholic is a django based webapp designed to serve GMs with a suite of tools for managing 
their RPG sessions. It assumes a 5e-like, initiative-based combat structure.
